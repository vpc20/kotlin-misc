                I like everything about my Pumpkin Spice Pixel 4 except for its crappy battery life. I should have gone
                extra-large.

                It seems like everyone (well, almost everyone) hates the Pixel 4. That's OK and hating things you never
                planned to buy is the secret fuel that powers the tech side of the internet. I'm not one of those people
                and think the Pixel 4 was a great upgrade from the 3 in almost every way. It's just that one place where
                it wasn't that's killing me.

                I'm talking, of course, about the battery life. I know, I know. You've heard it a million times and you
                want to click away or tell me to shut up we already know the small Pixel 4 has horrible battery life and
                that I'm just whining because I'm something or another. but I know when I bought it that it had "bad"
                battery life. I just didn't know it would be this bad.


                I'm not on my phone all day long, which is good because with the Pixel 4, I couldn't be.

<p class="intro">I like everything about my Pumpkin Spice Pixel 4 except for its crappy battery life. I should have gone extra-large.</p>

<p>It seems like everyone (well, <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pixel-4-xl-second-opinion-review" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite">almost everyone</a>) hates the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-4" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite">Pixel 4</a>. That's OK and hating things you never planned to buy is the secret fuel that powers the tech side of the internet. I'm not one of those people and think the Pixel 4 was a great upgrade from the 3 in almost every way. It's just that one place where it <em>wasn't</em> that's killing me.</p>

<p>I'm talking, of course, about the battery life. I know, I know. You've heard it a million times and you want to click away or tell me to shut up we already know the small Pixel 4 has horrible battery life and that I'm just whining because I'm something or another. but I know when I bought it that it had "bad" battery life. I just didn't know it would be this bad.</p>

<blockquote class="pull left">
  <p>I'm not on my phone all day long, which is good because with the Pixel 4, I couldn't be.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm not one who has their nose glued to their phone all day long. Normally, I primarily use a phone for messaging and email, maybe play a game or two and every great once in a while will watch a bit of YouTube. My small Pixel 4 will last all day almost every day. but it's those <em>other</em> days where I'm out taking photos or playing music that are a problem. It's making me wish I had opted for the XL, and I hate long skinny stupid XL things.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/i-hate-big-phones-i-really-wish-i-went-xl-pixel-4" title="I hate big phones, but I really wish I went XL with the Pixel 4" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite"><img src="https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2019/10/google-pixel-4-hands-4.jpg?itok=RoHd6HVF"></a></p>

<p>While you're reading this, I will be at the <a href="http://mdreptilefarm.com/northern-virginia-reptile-expo/" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite">Northern Virginia Reptile Expo</a>. I have been told I am not allowed to bring anything home with me, but I can and will be taking photos of all manner of scaly slithery things that I love. I'll also be carrying around a battery pack because I know my small Pixel 4 won't be able to do that and still have enough juice to play some music for the trip home.</p>

<blockquote class="pull right">
  <p>My Pixel 3 could last a day of taking photos and playing music. I just know my Pixel 4 can't. I should throw it into the ocean.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Last year, my small <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-3" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite">Pixel 3</a> &mdash; which also was supposed to have poor battery life &mdash; had no problem doing this same feat. Yet, after a few weeks of using my orange power-hungry little box, I know it just won't be able to do it. And that makes me sad. I love a lot about this phone and think it's probably the best Android phone you can buy today if it could only last all day.</p>

<p>The worst thing is outside of caving, sending it back and getting the bigger, sillier version (sorry, I just have these Long Tall Sally monstrosities) I have no interest in another Android phone. I guess I could go back to my Pixel 3, but like everyone else, I want new things; especially new things that my employer paid for.</p>

<p>I'm hoping that Google can keep tweaking how apps run and stretch just another hour or two out of the little Pixel 4's battery. I'm not completely confident because the software is only a part of the problem and the battery is just too small. I guess I'll just have to buy a big battery pack like the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pokemon-go" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite">Pokemon Go</a> players use.</p>

<p>Ugh.</p>

            <description>We're a bunch of nerds and avid video game lovers. Console wars aside, we love both Xbox and
                PlayStation, and we want to show you what makes each so great.


                Xbox One X

                Most powerful console on the market


                $350 at Best Buy

                Pros


                More powerful
                Xbox Game Pass cheaper than PlayStation Now, and is now bundled with Xbox Live
                Xbox Live services are faster and more reliable than PlayStation Network

                The Xbox One X arrived on the market at a time when Xbox was heavily critized for being underpowered.
                Thanks to a big GPU boost, it now holds the title of being the most powerful console currently on the
                market, capable of rendering games at 4K resolution and 60FPS.

                PlayStation 4 Pro

                Best exclusive experiences


                $400 at Best Buy

                Pros

<h2>What these features mean to you</h2>

<p>It's easy to be confused when looking at the specs of each machine. CPU? GPU? What do those even mean to the average consumer? We'll break down how they affect your gaming experience and the importance they play.</p>

<h3>CPU, GPU, and RAM</h3>

<p>To make this as simple as possible, the CPU (central processing unit), GPU (graphics processing unit), and RAM (random access memory) all dictate the console's power and performance, meaning they affect how well games run and look. Without these, the system cannot function.</p>

<p>The CPU can be thought of as the console's brain, processing countless calculations to get the system up and running. The GPU, as its name suggests, creates and renders the images and videos that you see on your display. RAM stores the data and memory that is currently being used by your system.</p>

<p>To make it even more simple: bigger numbers (when measured in the same units) are better in this regard. The bigger the number, the faster and more reliably it can process. When playing a video game, time means everything. The quicker it processes information, the smoother your overall experience.</p>

<h3>4K resolution and HDR support</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/xbox-one-x-vs-playstation-4-pro-which-should-you-buy" title="Xbox One X vs. PlayStation 4 Pro: Which should you buy?" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite"><img src="https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2018/11/4k-1080p-comparison.png?itok=WywsM7Ji"></a></p>

<p>Images are made up of thousands of small pixels. If an image has a higher pixel count, that means it is clearer and more crisp, visualizing more details. 4K images are considered ultra high definition at 3840x2160p (pixels), while normal high definition images are 1920x1080p. At a normal aspect ratio of 16:9 (a widescreen format), 4K images have 4 times the amount of pixels on screen than a 1080p image.</p>

<p>Though both consoles can render games at 4K resolution, the Xbox One X does so more often natively, meaning that the images are not checkerboarded. The PS4 Pro uses checkerboard 4K rendering more often. Checkerboarding means that the PS4 Pro will render only half of an image and then extrapolate that data to render the other half at a higher resolution to give the final image the illusion of being 4K. Instead of each pixel being a square, they are rectangles in the checkerboarding technique that the PS4 Pro uses. Native 4K is a crisper image, but it's quite honestly hard to tell the difference between checkerboarded and native 4K for most people as they are nearly identical to the human eye, especially when playing a fast-paced game.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/xbox-one-x-vs-playstation-4-pro-which-should-you-buy" title="Xbox One X vs. PlayStation 4 Pro: Which should you buy?" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite"><img src="https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2018/11/ps4-pro-hdr-promo.png?itok=fCJqvEQy"></a></p>

<p>Both consoles can supersample a 4K image, scaling it down on a lower resolution screen to give players the benefit of viewing a sharper image, but the <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2017/11/03/xbox-one-x-explaining-4k-hdr-supersampling/" title="" rel="nofollow" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite">Xbox One X does so by default</a>. On PS4 Pro, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-ie/get-help/help-library/system---hardware/sound---screen/ps4-pro-supersampling/" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite">you need to enable its supersampling mode in the settings</a>.</p>

<p>HDR (high dynamic range) produces more vivid colors by widening the range of luminosity. Instead of possibly looking washed-out, HDR provides higher contrast for a truer, more vibrant image. This is especially apparent with deeper blacks and brighter whites.</p>

<h3>Backward compatibility</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/xbox-one-x-vs-playstation-4-pro-which-should-you-buy" title="Xbox One X vs. PlayStation 4 Pro: Which should you buy?" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite"><img src="https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2018/11/xbox-one-backward-compatibility-banner.jpg?itok=kFV_l13Y"></a></p>

<p>Xbox One has a <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fmicrosoft.msafflnk.net%2Fc%2F159229%2F433017%2F7593%3FsubId1%3DUUacUdUnU71089YYr%26subId2%3Ddac%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.xbox.com%252Fen-US%252Fxbox-one%252Fbackward-compatibility&amp;token=LmTfwRe6" title="" rel="nofollow" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite">growing catalogue</a> of Xbox 360 and original Xbox games that are backward compatible, meaning they can be played on an Xbox One simply by popping in your old disc. The PlayStation 4 does not have such a feature. Though its paid streaming service PlayStation Now gives players access to older PS3 and PS2 games, you're still paying for them through the service. You can't dust off an old game you already own and play it on a PS4 like you can with the Xbox One. The catch for Xbox One is that not every game is backward compatible, but new games are added frequently to the list of titles that are, and they include some of the most popular Xbox 360 and original Xbox games.</p>

<p>Certain backward compatible Xbox 360 games are also enhanced on Xbox One X, bumping their resolution and frame rates.</p>

<h3>VR support</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/xbox-one-x-vs-playstation-4-pro-which-should-you-buy" title="Xbox One X vs. PlayStation 4 Pro: Which should you buy?" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite"><img src="https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2018/11/psvr-headset-promo.jpg?itok=ds3hBsOg"></a></p>

<p>When the Xbox One X was first introduced (under the name Project Scorpio), it was marketed as being able to support virtual reality experiences. Though it technically has the capability of supporting them, VR has yet to come to the console. On Sony's side, the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/playstation-vr-ultimate-guide" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite">PS4 has its own dedicated PSVR headset</a> with a catalogue of virtual reality games to choose from.</p>

<p>Virtual reality may make its way to Xbox in the future, but as of right now, PlayStation is firmly beating out the console competition in that regard.</p>

<h3>Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Now</h3>

<p>Xbox and PlayStation technically have their own "Netflix for games" services called <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fmicrosoft.msafflnk.net%2Fc%2F159229%2F433017%2F7593%3FsubId1%3DUUacUdUnU71089YYr%26subId2%3Ddac%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.xbox.com%252Fen-US%252Fxbox-game-pass&amp;token=8ekWwbDd" title="" rel="nofollow" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite">Xbox Game Pass</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/explore/playstation-now/" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite">PlayStation Now</a>, but Xbox's beats PlayStation's out of the water simply in quality, content, and ease of use.</p>

<p>For $10/month, Xbox Game Pass allows players to download and play a catalogue of hundreds of games, including the newest Xbox exclusive releases, which launch into the service the same day as their global release at retail. Don't want to pay $60 for a brand new Xbox exclusive game? Pick up Game Pass for a month. Simple solution. And because the games download directly to your Xbox, you don't need to worry about subpar internet speeds getting in the way of your enjoyment.</p>

<p>Xbox also offers the ability to bundle Xbox Game Pass with your Xbox Live subscription, charging $15/month for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. It's an incredibly affordable and easy method to not only stay connected, but also keep up with the latest games. Thanks to how frequently Microsoft updates Game Pass, and how they've promised to continue doing so with some of the biggest titles launching in the future, it's a no brainer if you're an Xbox owner or looking to pick one up.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/xbox-one-x-vs-playstation-4-pro-which-should-you-buy" title="Xbox One X vs. PlayStation 4 Pro: Which should you buy?" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite"><img src="https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2018/11/playstation-now-promo.jpg?itok=p3oOd3IR"></a></p>

<p>PlayStation Now, which also costs $10/month, is a streaming service, which can also lead to less reliable connections and greater lag. Buffering is already an annoyance when watching some of our favorite television shows on Netflix, but if you're playing a game with input lag because of slow internet speeds, it becomes nearly impossible to enjoy at times.</p>

<h3>What about Xbox Live Gold and PlayStation Plus?</h3>

<p>Comparing each system's premium online subscription service, Xbox Live Gold versus PlayStation Plus, is a whole other beast, but there are a few key differences and similarities that you'll want to know about before deciding which console is right for you.</p>

<p>In terms of similarities, both services cost $60 a year, offer a few free games each month (with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/12/2/16727700/playstation-plus-free-games-2017-value-analysis" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite">PS Plus</a> edging out <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/12/2/16717854/xbox-games-with-gold-free-games-2017-value-analysis" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite">Xbox Live Gold</a> in terms of monetary value), grant members larger discounts on games, and enable the ability to play online multiplayer. The quality of the online multiplayer, however, differs.</p>

<p>While the PlayStation Network has a larger playerbase, Xbox Live is <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fmicrosoft.msafflnk.net%2Fc%2F159229%2F433017%2F7593%3FsubId1%3DUUacUdUnU71089YYr%26subId2%3Ddac%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.xbox.com%252Fen-US%252Flive%252Fbetter-network&amp;token=RKqES1Tz" title="" rel="nofollow" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite">reported by the IHS Markit</a> in an independent study as being more stable and faster, therefore making it a more reliable place to play.</p>

<h2>Bottom line</h2>

<p>Normally this is where we'd recommend one product over the other, but there isn't necessarily a clear winner here. Objectively, the Xbox One X does have more power to run games at higher frame rates and resolution, but whether you care about that is entirely subjective. A lot of people are perfectly fine with playing a game at 1080p as opposed to 4K. The PS4 has more &mdash; and arguably better exclusives &mdash; but whether they suit your tastes depends on your preferences for single-player or multiplayer experiences.</p>

                All you need is ESPN+. (And Amazon Fire TV.)

                UFC 245 is nearly upon us. It's the final UFC event of 2019, and it's going to be good. (At least it
                better be good, because we keep saying it will be.

                On tap this Saturday, Dec. 14, is Kamaru Usman, who's taking on Colby Covington in the welterweight
                division. The fight is coming to us from Las Vegas.

                Like all big UFC events, this one's on Pay-Per-View. And like all UFC Pay-Per-View events, it's on
                ESPN+. That's the streaming-only flavor of ESPN. And if you don't already have it (it's very good),
                you'll need it to watch UFC 245. That's true whether you want to watch on your phone, or on a Roku &amp;mdash;
                or, yes, on your Amazon Fire TV. Which is what brings us here today.

                The ESPN+ is excellent on Amazon Fire TV, whether you're using the Amazon Fire TV Cube, or the Fire TV
                Stick 4K, or even the new Anker Nebula Soundbar, which is a Fire TV Edition joint.

<p class="intro">All you need is ESPN+. (And Amazon Fire TV.)</p>

<p>UFC 245 is nearly upon us. It's the final UFC event of 2019, and it's going to be good. (At least it better be good, because we keep saying it will be.</p>

<p>Like all big UFC events, this one's on Pay-Per-View. And like all UFC Pay-Per-View events, it's on ESPN+. That's the streaming-only flavor of ESPN.

<h2>How to get the ESPN app for Amazon Fire TV</h2>

<p>In order to watch UFC 245 on your Amazon Fire TV, you'll need the ESPN app. (That's because all UFC Pay-Per-View events are on ESPN+.)</p>

<p>The easiest way to get the ESPN app on your Fire TV probably is through a web browser. Here's how to do that:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Click here for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ESPN-Inc/dp/B00E81O27Y?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU84017YYr" title="" rel="nofollow" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite">Amazon Appstore page for the ESPN app</a>. (You may have to log in first.)</p>

<p><img src="https://www.cordcutters.com/sites/cordcutters.com/files/field/image/2019/12/fire-tv-espn-gif.gif" data-source="CordCutters"></p></li>
<li>In the drop-down menu, choose the Fire TV device you want to send the app to.</li>
<li>Click or tap on Deliver.</li>
</ol>

<p>Alternatively, just search for the ESPN app in the store directly on your Fire TV device. Your call. Either is fine.</p>

<p>After that, you'll need to log in to the ESPN app with your credentials.</p>

<h2>When is UFC 245, and who's on the card?</h2>

<p>UFC 245 is scheduled for Saturday, Dec. 14, 2019, from T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.</p>

<p>The Main Event features welterweights Kamaru Usman vs. Colby Covington in a title bout. The "Nigerian Nightmare" is 15-1-0 for his career. The American "Chaos" Covington has a similar record, with one fewer victory.</p>

<p>The rest of the Main Card should prove to have plenty of excitement as well. Max Holloway is facing Alexander Volkanovski in a Featherweight title bout. And Germaine de Randamie is looking to take down champion Amanda Nunes in the women's Bantamweight title fight, while Marlon Moraes and Jose Aldo, and Petr Yan and Urijah Faber go at it in a pair of non-title Bantamweight matchups.</p>

<p>The early prelims get going at 6:30 p.m. Eastern and are available on UFC Fight Pass. The prelims should start around 8 p.m. and are available on ESPN2.</p>

<p>The Main Event is scheduled for 10 p.m. Eastern and is available exclusively <a href="https://go.web.plus.espn.com/c/159229/555830/9070?subId1=UUacUdUnU84017YYr&amp;subId2=dac&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fplus.espn.com%2Fufc%2Fppv" title="" rel="nofollow" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite">on UFC Pay-Per-View on ESPN+</a>.</p>

<h2>How much does UFC 245 pay-per-view cost?</h2>

<p>UFC 245 is available exclusively on ESPN+. You've got a few options here, though &mdash; especially if you don't yet have an ESPN+ subscription &mdash; so pay attention if you're looking to save a little money.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you're not yet an ESPN+ subscriber, the best deal by far is to get UFC 245 and a year of ESPN+ service for just $79.99. That'll save you 25 percent compared to if you were to get them separately.</li>
<li>If you're paying for ESPN+ on a monthly basis, you can also upgrade to that $79.99 deal, which includes a year of ESPN+ as well as the UFC 245 PPV event.</li>
<li>If you're a current annual ESPN+ subscriber (or just want to get the UFC 245 PPV event on its own) it'll run you $59.99.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to watch UFC 245 outside the U.S. with a VPN</h2>

<p>Technically speaking, you can only watch UFC Pay-Per-View events from within the United States. But if you're living outside of the U.S., a solid VPN should be able to take are of you. That's because a VPN can make it appear that your computer is inside the United States. (Or, more accurately, it tunnels your internet traffic through a server within the U.S., which is the same sort of thing.</p>

<p>This is where it can get a little tricky, though. If you're going to be watching via a phone or a computer, it's just a matter of firing up a VPN and going from there.</p>

<p>If you're trying to use a VPN with your Roku in order to watch UFC 245, you're going to need to do it at the network level, and not just the device level. So you're going to need to have a router that supports VPNs internally.</p>

<p>As far as which VPN to use to watch UFC 245? May we recommend:</p>

<h3 class="category reco-block">VPN for UFC 245</h3>

            <description>

                Wireless earbuds don&amp;rsquo;t tend to enjoy a very great reputation among serious listeners&amp;mdash;due
                to the fact that they almost always lack the kind of Hi-Fi clarity that most audiophiles crave.

                These&amp;nbsp;HUB: Hi-Fi Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds, however, manage to break the mold by
                offering supreme sonics along with an incredibly compact and comfortable design, and they&amp;rsquo;re
                currently on sale for 70% off at just $74.99.

                With Bluetooth 5.0 technology and a whopping 100 hours of total playback time with the included charging
                case, these intrepid earbuds were made with serious listeners in mind.

                They deliver a rich low-end alongside crystal-clear highs and a solid midrange, and you&amp;rsquo;ll be
                able to take them with you on any adventure thanks to an IPX5 waterproof rating. Making and taking calls
                on the go is also a breeze thanks to voice assistant support.

<p>Among the banter you can engage in with Sam, you can have him wake you up with an alarm, sing you Happy Birthday, or tell you where he is from. The celebrity voice skills don't have full Alexa functionality though, so don't expect Sam to be able to set reminders or add items to your to-do list for you (he'd probably scoff at that anyway!).</p>

I would expect this Samuel L. Jackson official Alexa Skill to be the first of many from Amazon, but I can't quite guess who will be next.</p>

<p>Who would <strong>you</strong> like to hear from your Echo? Ellen DeGeneres? James Earl Jones? Christopher Walken? Betty White?</p>

                There are concerns about Chinese investment in apps like TikTok.

                What you need to know


                Apple and Google have been asked about the disclosure mobile apps must provide regarding overseas ties.
                The chair of a U.S. congressional panel has written to both companies on the issue.
                Rep. Stephen Lynch cited recent press reports of national security risks over the data of U.S. Citizens.


                Chair of a U.S. congressional panel Rep. Stephen Lynch has written to Apple and Google regarding whether
                or not app developers are required to disclose overseas ties.

                As reported by Reuters, Lynch revealed his request in a statement on Friday. This follows concerns that
                have been raised about the use of data by apps that have ties or investment with overseas countries, in
                particular, China.

                In his statement he said:

<p>Chair of a U.S. congressional panel Rep. Stephen Lynch has written to Apple and Google regarding whether or not app developers are required to disclose overseas ties.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tech-nationalsecurity/google-apple-asked-if-apps-like-tiktok-must-disclose-foreign-ties-idUSKBN1YH2B5" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite">Reuters</a>, Lynch revealed his request in a statement on Friday.

U.S. laws permit mobile applications to collect massive amounts of personal information about their users."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whilst there has been a lot of scrutiny over the use of user data recently, Tik Tok and China have been given a particularly hard time over the issue. The report notes that Tik Tok is being scrutinized by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).

<p>The report notes that TikTok owners ByteDance has sought to distance its app from much of its Chinese operations in wake of the scrutiny.</p>

<p>Neither Apple nor Google have commented on the most recent question of disclosure of overseas ties.</p></div></div></div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/androidcentral/~4/i-c5rWcOh0k" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>]]></content:encoded>

                A Darksiders experience from a new perspective.

                Darksiders Genesis is a top-down action game that takes you through a variety of levels. Unlike the
                interconnected nature of Diablo III, you teleport into various environments and are tasked with
                uncovering a number of secrets and defeating bosses. While the story is a little convoluted and hard to
                follow, the gameplay is sublime. The ability to freely move around the world and slay hordes of demons
                with two distinct characters feels incredible.

                Darksiders Genesis

                $40


                Bottom line: Darksiders Genesis is a great top-down action game despite some minor issues.


                Pros:


                Replayable levels
                Great visuals
                Satisfying combat
                Hilarious dialogue

<p>Darksiders Genesis may look like Diablo III, but it features a number of puzzles, the ability to jump, glide, ride a horse, and traverse the levels in a number of ways. This freedom of movement allows you to find hidden chests and other collectibles during its short, but memorable campaign.</p>

<p>From the get-go, you're given control of two characters. War is the Horseman of the Apocalypse we've come to know, but Strife is a welcome addition. Strife's carefree attitude and witty banter is the perfect foil to War's serious demeanor. You should listen to the interactions because they're hilarious. Luckily, both of them possess unique skills, too.</p>

<p>Strife relies on guns and long-range attacks to take out enemies. This comes in handy when you can't get close to certain foes. There's even a laser beam-like super ability thrown in there. War, on the other hand, comes with a giant sword and can take out certain creatures with ease through melee attacks. If you're playing on your own, you can easily switch between both heroes so you'll have to decide who's better equipped for any given combat scenario. If you're playing in co-op, you and your friend will control one character each.</p>

<h2>Darksiders Genesis <em>secrets and upgrades</em></h2>

<p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/darksiders-genesis-stadia-review-diablo-action-game-worth-buying" title="Darksiders Genesis for Google Stadia review: Is this Diablo-like action game worth buying?" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite"><img src="https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/12/darksiders_genesis_stadia_2.jpg?itok=YzAe5oys"></a></p>

<p>Darksiders Genesis features a lot of replayability because, as you gain new abilities, you'll have to return to past areas and access new pathways. If you're unsure what a magical plate does or can't break a particular structure, come back after progressing further in the story. Usually, health upgrades or Trickster Keys are hidden in these unreachable locations. Both come in handy because the game gets progressively more difficult as the levels go by.</p>

<p>Upgrading your characters is the key to success in Darksiders Genesis. While the system may seem a little complex, adding cores to your skill tree makes you stronger because you acquire new skills. However, you can also purchase new moves and upgrades &ndash; from damage output to health upgrades &ndash; by visiting the hub world and talking to the various demon merchants like Vulgrim. Souls and Boatman's Coins that you collect from each level are used as currency.</p>

<h2>Darksiders Genesis <em>performance and visuals</em></h2>

<p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/darksiders-genesis-stadia-review-diablo-action-game-worth-buying" title="Darksiders Genesis for Google Stadia review: Is this Diablo-like action game worth buying?" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite"><img src="https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/12/darksiders_genesis_stadia_3.jpg?itok=j7RMLOLC"></a></p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, Darksiders Genesis looks and plays the best on PC due to the variety of settings you can tweak. Unfortunately, it doesn't appear to feature any enhancements on Google Stadia. The game appears to be running at 1080p resolution and 60 frames per second. The connection we played on was 330 Mbps and the Chromecast Ultra was connected to an ethernet cable. While the stream quality was broadcasting at 4K resolution, everything outside of the menus was a little blurry.</p>

<p>By no means does Darksiders Genesis look horrendous on Stadia &ndash; it's quite a beautiful game &ndash; but I would've liked to see a higher resolution presentation like that found in Metro Exodus or Trials Rising. Since those games manage to render at 4K, it's possible. Shockingly enough, additional input lag was barely noticeable, and I quickly adjusted to the difference. The real issue with Google's platform at the moment is the image quality in my opinion. Games that should run at 4K run at 1080p due to poor optimization.</p>

<p>A great example of this problem is Final Fantasy XV which reaches 4K on <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/xbox-one-x" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite">Xbox One X</a>, but only 1080p on Stadia. Stadia has an almost 5 teraflop advantage over Microsoft's machine. Developers need to optimize their games for Google's hardware.</p>

<h2>Darksiders Genesis <em>final thoughts</em></h2>

<p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/darksiders-genesis-stadia-review-diablo-action-game-worth-buying" title="Darksiders Genesis for Google Stadia review: Is this Diablo-like action game worth buying?" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite"><img src="https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/12/darksiders_genesis_stadia_4.jpg?itok=wqmJSyM3"></a></p>

<p>Overall, Darksiders Genesis is a great game, but it would've been even better with a better story and less confusing skill tree. The Darksiders Universe is complex and telling a mature tale would've served the title well. However, these are only minor grievances because the gameplay is incredibly responsive and performance is buttery smooth on PC and Stadia.</p>

<p>Darksiders Genesis won't be available on Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 4 until February 2020, so if you want to experience it, you should either play it on PC or Stadia. If you don't have a gaming laptop or desktop, you should check it out on Stadia because it's the first reason to subscribe to Google's service in my opinion. It's just that good.</p>

                Hand tracking doesn't do much at the moment.

                The Oculus Quest is a standalone virtual reality (VR) headset that doesn't require any cables to be
                connected to your PC. The device has received a number of new features in recent months, but hand
                tracking may be the most significant. Yesterday, Oculus updated the Quest software so that you can
                enable hand tracking as an Experimental Feature.


                Menu navigation

                You can interact with the Oculus Quest menu from the Library to the Store. Just point at and pinch
                whatever you want to select. The same applies to fast-forwarding or rewinding trailers in the Oculus
                Store.

                Oculus services

                Select apps like the Oculus Browser, Oculus TV, photo library, and more work with hand tracking as well.
                However, it's not perfect and deleting screenshots is cumbersome because you have to select minuscule
                trash can icons.

                Only official uploads to platforms like YouTube, Spotify, and Apple Music will be counted.

                What you need to know


                Billboard is changing how it determines the popularity of music on its charts.
                It announces this week that it will start including online music videos in its Billboard 200 rankings.
                However, the company noted that only 'official' views from established platforms would be tallied.


                The music landscape has changed significantly in the last decade, thanks to the disruption caused by
                tech and streaming companies in how we consume entertainment. As a result, Billboard says it's changing
                with the times and will start incorporating views of online music videos in its popularity rankings for
                albums. Notably, the Billboard 200 charts, which show the 200 most popular albums each week, will now
                include views from YouTube, Apple Music, Spotify, and more.

<p>The music landscape has changed significantly in the last decade, thanks to the disruption caused by tech and streaming companies in how we consume entertainment. As a result, Billboard <a href="http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/8546247/billboard-200-changes-youtube-video-data-streaming-album-charts" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite">says it's changing with the times</a> and will start incorporating views of online music videos in its popularity rankings for albums.

<p>"As the steward of the definitive charts that uphold the industry's measurement of music consumption, our goal is to continually respond and accurately reflect the changing landscape of the music," said Billboard's Deanna Brown.</p>

<p>The company's metrics have included video views for song-specific charts since 2013, but for some reason, were left wanting when it came to whole albums. With this change, not only will the Billboard 200 charts incorporate video streaming, but the genre-specific album charts, too, will pay heed to all your Frozen II soundtrack marathons on YouTube.</p>

<p>YouTube's global head of music, Lyor Cohen, applauded the move as a "very important moment in making the chart a more accurate representation of what people are listening to." He also added that with the incorporation of video data into album charts, genres like Latin, hip-hop, and electronic, which have regularly been staples of YouTube viewers' daily music fix, would have far better representation as a result.</p>

<p>The changes to Billboard's rankings will go into effect early next year, starting from January 18.</p>

                Select the About tab and check if a software update is available. Make sure your Quest is running the

<p>If you want to enable hand tracking on your Quest, just follow the instructions below.</p>

<p>Select the About tab and check if a software update is available. Make sure your Quest is running the latest software by confirming that the top right corner of the window says No Updates Available. If a software update is available, start installing it and plug in your headset to the bundled charger. Wait for it to update and go back to Settings after the update is done.</p>

<h2>Open Experimental Features</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-enable-oculus-quest-hand-tracking" title="How to enable Oculus Quest hand tracking" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite"><img src="https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/12/experimental_features.jpg?itok=VD0nQpeU"></a></p>

<p>Above About in Settings, you'll notice the Experimental Features tab. Click on it and you should see an option to toggle hand tracking. You may need to restart your headset in order to see this option. Toggle hand tracking on and you're good to go.</p>

<p>To use hand tracking, you can click on Settings and the quick-access menu bar will give you the option to use your hands. Unfortunately, hand tracking is still quite rough around the edges so don't expect for it to become the primary way you navigate.</p>

<p>Are you using hand tracking already on Quest? What do you think of it? Let us know.</p>

                It's set to overtake UPS to become the largest shipping provider by 2022.

                What you need to know


                Morgan Stanley estimates Amazon Logistics, the retail giant's in-house shipping solution, is now
                shipping 2.5 billion packages per year.
                That amounts to 50% of all its deliveries in the U.S.
                The investment bank also estimates that the company may overtake UPS to become the largest shipping
                service in the country by 2022.


                Amazon is rapidly expanding its shipping capabilities, with Morgan Stanley estimating that the company
                has more than doubled shipments in the U.S. in the last year alone (via CNBC). Its in-house shipping
                wing now accounts for nearly 50% of all Amazon deliveries in the country this year, up from just 20%
                last year. To truly understand the scope of Amazon's operation, here's another statistic: the investment
                bank estimates Amazon is currently shipping at a rate of 2.5 billion packages per year, compared to an

</ul>

<p>Amazon is rapidly expanding its shipping capabilities, with Morgan Stanley estimating that the company has more than doubled shipments in the U.S. in the last year alone (via <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/12/analyst-amazon-delivering-nearly-half-its-packages-instead-of-ups-fedex.html" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite"><em>CNBC</em></a>). Its in-house shipping wing now accounts for nearly 50% of all Amazon deliveries in the country this year, up from just 20% last year. To truly understand the scope of Amazon's operation, here's another statistic: the investment bank estimates Amazon is currently shipping at a rate of 2.5 billion packages per year, compared to an estimated 4.7 billion and 3 billion packages per year for UPS and FedEx, respectively.</p>

<p>A large part of this growth is focused on more densely populated urban areas, with Morgan Stanley attributing Amazon's burgeoning rise to its efficient use of technology. "To us, Amazon Logistics is already-large scale and with a fleet ~1/5 the size of competitors, it speaks to its ability to use density and technology to drive efficiency," said the bank.</p>

<p>It also expects Amazon Logistics to become the market leader in the U.S. shipping space in just three more years, accounting for 6.5 billion shipments per year, compared to forecasts of 5 billion and 3.7 billion packages for UPS and FedEx by the same time, respectively.</p>

<p>However, the breakneck pace of Amazon's shipping capabilities has come at a high human cost as we <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-cuts-ties-delivery-firms-leaving-2000-jobs-lurch" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite">reported earlier in the year</a>. The smaller companies &mdash; called delivery service providers &mdash; that Amazon depends on for most of its last-mile deliveries report horrific working conditions, which have also led to three fatalities. While Amazon cut its ties with the companies involved in those incidents, it had reportedly begun relationships with new companies working out of the same warehouses and hiring the same workers soon after, raising questions about how many more mishaps might await us in the future as the company nearly triples its shipping volumes in the next three years.</p></div></div></div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/androidcentral/~4/44wmjtLb8kY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>]]></content:encoded>

            <description>

                Wi-Fi 6 was designed with the future of routers in mind. A router spends most of its time directing and
                managing network traffic to keep speeds high even with a ton of connections. As our homes get smarter,
                we have more connections than ever that need to check in consistently and reliably. Wi-Fi 6 then allows
                for more connections than ever and still manages to kick the speed up a notch. Wi-Fi 6 isn't just for
                enthusiasts anymore and even in mesh, there is an option for nearly anyone, although the Arris SURFboard
                mAX Plus Mesh is our top pick for people who want top speeds.

                Best Overall: Arris SURFboard mAX Plus Mesh AX7800


                Despite having a silly way of capitalizing letters, the Arris SURFboard mAX Plus Mesh is a serious set

<p>Despite having a silly way of capitalizing letters, the Arris SURFboard mAX Plus Mesh is a serious set of Wi-Fi 6 routers with a fast backhaul for top speeds. Arris has some experience in networking and you may recognize the Arris name from many modems and routers provided by ISPs.</p>

<p>Boasting support for AX7800 speeds, the Arris SURFboard series dedicates four data streams to a fast 4.8Gbps backhaul to keep speeds between routers as high as possible. While the wireless features are impressive, the wired performance leaves something to be desired. That's not all bad if you want a Wi-Fi focused network and have little need for wireless connectivity.</p>

<p>There are four Ethernet ports per unit on the bottom of the main router, one will be used for uplink all the time with another able to be used with link aggregation for faster speeds. While a faster Ethernet option would have been nice, most people likely won't need more than the available 2Gbps for internet any time soon. For any normal usage, this should be plenty fast.</p>

<h3 class="pros">Pros:</h3>

<ul>
<li>4x 1Gbps Ethernet per unit</li>
<li>Link Aggregation</li>
<li>Fast AX7800 speeds</li>

<p>Netgear's Orbi line is one of the most flexible mesh networking systems and the Nighthawk line has one of the most complete Wi-Fi 6 offerings. This all comes together with the affectionately named RK852, a Wi-Fi 6 version of Netgear's Orbi mesh routers. While it's quite expensive, it's also quite fast at AX6000 with tri-band and comes with Netgear's respected Orbi software.</p>

<p>The addition of this package to Netgear's Orbi family makes it one of the fastest mesh networks available with a design that fits in with the modern and stylish appearance that people have come to expect from mesh routers. The Orbi should be fairly easy to blend in with any room's decor.</p>

<p>On the back of the main router is a 2.5Gbps WAN Ethernet port that can be combined with one of the four gigabit LAN Ethernet ports to support an even higher speed uplink. This high-speed uplink is the main thing that keeps this router ahead of the competition for high-speed coverage. The satellite router also comes with four Ethernet ports allowing for up to eight wired devices to be connected at once.</p>

<h2 class="separator">Best Value: <em>Asus RT-AX92U</em></h2>

<p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wi-fi-6-mesh-routers" title="Best Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Routers in 2019" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite"><img src="https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/12/asus-ax92u-top-angle.jpg?itok=sb-Ag7Ot"></a></p>

<p>Asus was one of the first companies to make a Wi-Fi 6 router for consumers and quickly followed that up with the RT-AX92U mesh system. Thanks to fast tri-band speeds, these routers can connect with a fast backhaul of up to 4.8Gbps and each unit has four gigabit Ethernet ports.</p>

<p>Disappointingly, there is no multi-gig Ethernet but link aggregation can combine two of the gigabit ports for up to 2Gbps internet support. This will be quite a bit faster than most people have access to. Thanks to Asus' AiMesh software, another Asus router can be added in as a mesh point, but you'll need to make sure it has full tri-band Wi-Fi 6 support to get the most out of your network</p>

<p>I like the more traditional gaming router appearance. The gamer aesthetic here isn't for nothing since Asus built in its gaming software to keep ping times low and prioritize game traffic on your network. Gaming and mesh don't normally go together but Asus has managed to bring the two together with some of the best technology available.</p>

<h3 class="pros">Pros:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Link Aggregation</li>

<h2 class="separator">Best WPA3: <em>Linksys MX10 Velop</em></h2>

<p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wi-fi-6-mesh-routers" title="Best Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Routers in 2019" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite"><img src="https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/12/linksys-velop-ax5-ax10-couch.jpg?itok=CvDpTn4N"></a></p>

<p>The Linksys MX10 Velop is just the name given to the two-pack of Linksys MX5 Velops. These routers are capable of delivering AX7800 speeds across three Wi-Fi bands. While these speeds are quite high, the wired connection to your modem will max out at 1Gbps and other wired devices will be limited to the same speed. While this is more than enough for the vast majority of people, it would have been nice to see more wired capability.</p>

<p>Four Ethernet ports and a USB 3.0 port on each unit allow for a lot of expansion. The Wi-Fi 6 Velops are quite a bit larger than the Velop dual-band or tri-band AC mesh routers. Compared to a traditional router, however, the internal antennas help keep the appearance understated.</p>

<p>If you already have a Velop system, there's no need to get rid of it thanks to compatibility with the entire Velop family of routers. The most powerful routers, in this case the Wi-Fi 6 Velops, should be connected directly to the modem with the older routers providing extra coverage in areas that don't need as much speed.</p>

<h3 class="pros">Pros:</h3>

<ul>
<li>4x 1Gbps Ethernet per unit</li>
<li>AX7800 speeds</li>
<li>Tri-band</li>

<h2 class="separator">Best Mesh Add-on: <em>Netgear Nighthawk EAX80</em></h2>

<p>If you've already bought a Wi-Fi 6 router, like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/NETGEAR-Nighthawk-8-Stream-AX6000-Router/dp/B01MQDZXA4/?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU80536YYr" title="" rel="nofollow" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite">Netgear Nighthawk AX8</a> but find yourself needing more coverage, Netgear has a solution. The Netgear Nighthawk EAX80 is an eight-stream Wi-Fi 6 mesh expansion capable of speeds up to AX6000. It's compatible with any existing router, though I would recommend a Wi-Fi 6 router with at least a matching eight data streams.</p>

<p>You can set this router up with the same Wi-Fi name as your existing wireless network so there's no need to manually switch between two different networks like older extenders.</p>

<p>Four gigabit Ethernet ports onboard and a USB 3.0 port make this a great way to bring the network to your media setup or a desktop PC that doesn't have Wi-Fi. You can also use it to improve the signal to the rest of your home like any mesh.</p>

<p>There are a lot more if-then considerations due to the extender being reliant on the speeds of the base router but this is true for any mesh. If you have already invested in Wi-Fi 6 and just need a bit more coverage, this is a great option.</p>

<h3 class="pros">Pros:</h3>

<ul>
<li>4x 1Gbps Ethernet</li>
<li>Keep your Wi-Fi name</li>

<h2 class="separator">Can you make your own mesh?</h2>

<p>Something to keep in mind about mesh networks is that pretty much any router with a powerful enough CPU and enough RAM can technically act as a mesh router. Asus has taken this further than most other manufacturers by including its <a href="https://www.asus.com/us/site/aimesh/" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite">AiMesh</a> in nearly all of its routers. It is technically possible to put together your own Wi-Fi 6 mesh with compatible routers but the setup process will be more complicated than a complete mesh system. This technology is more promising with Wi-Fi 6 routers thanks to the improved capacity and speeds over previous generations of routers.</p>

<h2>Bottom line</h2>

<p>Like most cool new technology, Wi-Fi 6 is still pretty expensive to get into but the prices are starting to come down. Being able to connect more devices at once as well as a good speed jump over previous generations makes the upgrade to Wi-Fi 6 worth it to many internet users and especially to people that use network storage at home. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ARRIS-Surfboard-Plus-AX7800-Router/dp/B07MD414J4/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=arris+surfboard+max&amp;qid=1570034344&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-1&amp;tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU80536YYr" title="" rel="nofollow" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite">Arris SURFboard mAX Plus</a> is one of the most focused Wi-Fi 6 mesh systems available and should be more than enough for most people for years to come.</p>

                Yes, this a list of every kill in The Mandolorian, but first we created some ground rules. Victims who
                are punched or shocked are not confirmed kills. If someone gets shot and doesn't get back up, we assume
                they were killed, since the only shots we see that don't kill when they hit are blocked by beskar steel.
                Some offscreen kills are implied, so they count, as noted. Also when we say "pop" we specifically mean
                disintegrate, and those are our favorite kills. When you're ready to play along at home, here's a list
                of all the fun toys from The Mandalorian so you can look on disapprovingly, just like The Child/Baby

                Will Facebook be able to merge its platforms as intended?

                What you need to know


                Facebook is seemingly under increasing governmental scrutiny over its control of three of the biggest
                chat platforms in existence.
                The Wall Street Journal reports the FTC is looking into the social media giant's plans to integrate the

<p class="intro">Will Facebook be able to merge its platforms as intended?</p>

<h2 class="aside news-summary">What you need to know</h2>

<ul class="end">
<li>Facebook is seemingly under increasing governmental scrutiny over its control of three of the biggest chat platforms in existence.</li>
<li>The Wall Street Journal reports the FTC is looking into the social media giant's plans to integrate the three platforms into one.</li>
<li>The FTC may seek an injunction to stop the move, according to the report.</li>
</ul>

<p>Facebook has reportedly been hard at work at <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/facebook-reportedly-creating-deep-integrations-messenger-instagram-and-whatsapp" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite">amalgamating its three chat platforms</a> &mdash; Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram &mdash; since the start of the year. The company's toil may all have been for naught, however, if recent concerns by the FTC come to pass. The Wall Street Journal reports the federal agency has become increasingly more intrigued by the company's plans and may be looking to stop it in its tracks.</p>

<p>While concerns about Facebook monopolizing online messaging are not unfounded, the fact that Facebook already owns WhatsApp and Instagram means an injunction at this point might be too little, too late via a vis Facebook's power over our social lives. Indeed, the report suggests that the FTC's increasing scrutiny may not be borne entirely of competition concerns; instead, the agency may be looking to stop any further integration between the three platforms to leave open the door to breaking up Facebook at some point in the future, a task that would become monumentally more difficult if their backends were more entangled with one another.</p>

<p>On the flip side, Facebook's success in doing so would not only signify a monumental feat of engineering, but it would also yield significant benefits for users of all three platforms. For one, it would enable a WhatsApp user to chat with someone on Instagram without having an account on the photo-sharing website. It would potentially also dramatically expand the opportunities available to those conducting business using Facebook's various commercial and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/facebook-wants-take-apple-pay-and-venmo-its-own-payment-service" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite">financial offerings</a>. Most important of all, it would allow for encrypted communication across all three platforms.</p>

<p>An injunction by the agency is not a given yet and would require three out of its five commissioners to vote for it. However, the Journal reports that if it does come to pass, we could see the FTC taking action against Facebook as soon as January. Meanwhile, the Justice Department is reportedly also <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-probe-antitrust/justice-department-to-open-facebook-antitrust-investigation-source-idUSKBN1WA35M" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite">looking to open up its own antitrust investigation</a> into the tech giant, with some reports suggesting that investigation will also look closely at past acquisitions by the company, such as those of WhatsApp and Instagram.</p>

                You'll need to update both Google Messages and Carrier Services for the change to take effect.

                What you need to know


                Google has finally completed the process of rolling out RCS to users in the U.S.
                The company is well ahead of its previous promise of broad availability by the end of the year.
                Updates to both Google Messages and the Carrier Services app may be required to enable the new chat
                experience.


                Earlier in the week, we reported on an update to the Carrier Services app that enabled RCS for Verizon
                users. As it turns out, the feature update applied to all remaining users in the U.S. who didn't have
                RCS yet, allowing Google to complete its rollout much earlier than its previous estimates. As Google's
                Communications Suite Lead Sanaz Ahari announced on Twitter:

                Hi everyone! RCS is now available to all users in US as of Monday. Make sure to update both Messages and
                Carrier Services.&amp;mdash; Sanaz (@sanazahari) December 12, 2019


                While Ahari suggests updating Carrier Services ...

<p>Earlier in the week, we reported on an update to the Carrier Services app that <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/carrier-services-update-enables-rcs-verizon-more-android-phones" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite">enabled RCS for Verizon users</a>. As it turns out, the feature update applied to all remaining users in the U.S. who didn't have RCS yet, allowing Google to complete its rollout much earlier than its <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-rolling-out-rcs-all-android-users-us-today" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite">previous estimates</a>.

<p>While Ahari suggests updating Carrier Services may be essential to getting the new chat experience, some of the responses to her tweet show users receiving RCS functionality even without the Carrier Services update. Either way, it's probably best to cover your bases and do as the lady says: get the latest versions of both Google Messenger and Carrier Services.</p>

<p>What about the rest of the world, you ask? Well, someone did ask Ahari the same thing. A cryptic "stay tuned" was all she gave us non-Americans.</p>

<p>If you live in the U.S., though, you'll now have an iMessage-like experience on your Android smartphone, which means you can see when someone's typing a response or if they've received/read your messages. You can also send larger multimedia files than was possible with the old MMS standard, and you can do so using your internet connection, without accruing additional charges. Quite the upgrade over SMS, indeed.</p>

            <description>A surprisingly competitive offering.


                What you need to know


                Google's YouTube Premium has found some success in India.
                The firm's growth rate outpaces that of local behemoths like Gaana Music.
                This has mostly been attributed to Google's YouTube Music service, which pulls in more paid users than
                rivals.


                Google's paid YouTube Music service is actually competitive in some regions. According to a report from
                Bloomberg, the service has outpaced Spotify and local services like Gaana Music in India and signed up
                over 800,000 subscribers in the region.

                To put the numbers in context, Gaana Music has over 125 million users overall and a bit more than 1
                million users for its paid service. It has been around for a decade, launching in April 2010. YouTube
                Premium made its Indian debut in March.

                According to Bloomberg, YouTube Music drives the uptake of the paid Premium service. While services like

<p>Google's paid YouTube Music service is actually competitive in some regions.

<p>According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, YouTube Music drives the uptake of the paid Premium service. While services like Spotify allow users to play music in the background with the occasional ads, YouTube Music needs a premium subscription for that. YouTube bundles both ad-free YouTube and YouTube Premium together for rs 129 (about $1.80) and also offers <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-premium-and-music-premium-prepaid-plans-introduced-india" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite">pay as you go plans.</a> It's no wonder the firm is more easily able to pull people over in a more price-sensitive market compared to local competitors.</p>

<p>YouTube Music isn't a perfect service, far from it. But as this report shows, it's not without its audience. Now, Google needs to work on making it work better for everyone.</p>

                One of the most important features of your smartphone is its storage. This is how you download your
                favorite apps, save all of your special photos, download music playlists for long road trips &amp;mdash;
                you name it. The longer you hold onto your phone, the more likely it is you'll start to run out of space

                free up storage space on your Android phone.

<h2>Check how much storage your phone has</h2>

<p>First thing's first, we should take a look at how much space is left on your phone. It's a good idea to go through and clean stuff up every now and then regardless of how much space you have, but if you still have ample room to go, there's no sense in going overboard.</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the <strong>Settings</strong> on your phone.</li>
<li><p>Tap <strong>Storage</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-free-storage-space-android" title="How to free up storage space on Android" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite"><img src="https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/12/how-to-free-up-storage-android-1.jpg?itok=ASjpMXTf"></a><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-free-storage-space-android" title="How to free up storage space on Android" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite"><img src="https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/12/how-to-free-up-storage-android-2.jpg?itok=OEtnpDoA"></a><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-free-storage-space-android" title="How to free up storage space on Android" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite"><img src="https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/12/how-to-free-up-storage-android-3.jpg?itok=SxAfWLlg"></a></p></li>
</ol>

<p>At the very top of the page, you'll see how many gigabytes of storage you've used, along with a percentage to better put things in perspective.</p>

<h2>Delete app data and files</h2>

<p>Now that you're at the Storage page, it's time to start taking action. The first thing we're going to recommend you do is to delete app data and files.</p>

<p>Everything is broken up into handy categories, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Photos &amp; videos </li>
<li>Music &amp; audio</li>
<li>Games</li>
<li>Movie &amp; TV apps</li>
<li>Other apps</li>
<li>Files</li>
<li>System</li>
</ul>

<p>Tapping on one of these categories will then show a list of apps that fall under it, and this is where you'll go for deleting data on a per-app basis. Here's an example of what this looks like:</p>

<ol>
<li>Tap on the category you want (we're using Music &amp; audio).</li>
<li>Tap on an app.</li>

<p>As you'll see on the pop-up that appears on your screen, doing this will delete "all files, settings, accounts, databases, etc." In other words, just about everything except the app itself is deleted. If there's an app on your phone that you want to keep installed but don't use that often, this can be helpful.</p>

<p>You can also tap on the Files category to be taken to your phone's file manager, making it easy to delete any random downloads you may have forgotten about.</p>

<h2>Use Android's "Free up space" tool</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-free-storage-space-android" title="How to free up storage space on Android" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite"><img src="https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/12/how-to-free-up-storage-android-3.jpg?itok=SxAfWLlg"></a><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-free-storage-space-android" title="How to free up storage space on Android" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite"><img src="https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/12/how-to-free-up-storage-android-9.png?itok=OIIpylvG"></a><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-free-storage-space-android" title="How to free up storage space on Android" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite"><img src="https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/12/how-to-free-up-storage-android-10.png?itok=VFXmFylM"></a></p>

<p>On the Storage page, you'll see a button at the top called "Free up space." Tapping on this will take you through a guided process for clearing up saved files/apps on your phone that Android doesn't think you need.</p>

<p>This is broken up into three categories, including <strong>Backed up photos &amp; videos</strong>, <strong>Downloads</strong>, and <strong>Infrequently used apps</strong>. Just tap on the checkbox next to any of these items, tap the <strong>Free up</strong> button at the bottom-right of the screen, and you'll give your phone a bunch of extra space just like that.</p>

<h2>Make sure Smart Storage is turned on</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-free-storage-space-android" title="How to free up storage space on Android" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite"><img src="https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/12/how-to-free-up-storage-android-3.jpg?itok=SxAfWLlg"></a><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-free-storage-space-android" title="How to free up storage space on Android" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite"><img src="https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/12/how-to-free-up-storage-android-12.jpg?itok=J3dJMK90"></a><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-free-storage-space-android" title="How to free up storage space on Android" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite"><img src="https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/12/how-to-free-up-storage-android-13.jpg?itok=frWbJuI6"></a></p>

<p>Pictures and videos you take with your phone can be one of the biggest reasons for running out of storage, and Android has a pretty cool way to minimize their effect.</p>

<p>Again from the main Storage page, Tap <strong>Smart Storage</strong> right above the app categories we previously talked about. From here, you have a couple of things you can do.</p>

<p>The toggle will be moved to the right and have an accent color behind it if it's turned on, which it should be for most people. If you tap on <strong>Remove backed up photos &amp; videos</strong> below that, you can choose whether you wanted your backed up files to be deleted if they're over 30, 60, or 90 days old.</p>

<p>All of the pictures and videos you've ever captured will always be available in Google Photos. This feature simply removes the local versions of them that are taking up unnecessary space on your device.</p>

<h2>Buy a microSD card</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-free-storage-space-android" title="How to free up storage space on Android" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite"><img src="https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2018/05/galaxy-s9-plus-sim-card-sd-card-slot.jpg?itok=BsVbY2JZ"></a></p>

<p>Last but certainly not least, you can always go out and buy a microSD card if your phone supports them.</p>

<p>MicroSD cards are available in a myriad of different sizes, including 32GB, 64GB, and 128GB, just to name a few. There are <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android" georiot-ignore="true" class="norewrite">a ton of cards out there</a> for you to choose from, with many of them being more affordable than you might be thinking.</p>

<p>Not all Android phones offer expandable storage, so ensure yours does before going out and buying a card that may not work with your device.</p>
